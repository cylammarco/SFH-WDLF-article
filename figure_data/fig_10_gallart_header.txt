Abstract:
    The study of the Milky Way is living a golden era thanks to the
    enormous high-quality datasets delivered by Gaia, and space
    asteroseismic and ground-based spectroscopic surveys. However, the
    current major challenge to reconstructing the chronology of the Milky
    Way is the difficulty to derive precise stellar ages for large samples
    of stars. The colour-magnitude diagram (CMD) fitting technique
    offers an alternative to individual age determinations to derive the
    star formation history (SFH) of complex stellar populations.

    Our aim is to obtain a detailed dynamically evolved SFH (deSFH) of the
    solar neighbourhood, and the age and metallicity distributions that
    result from it. We define deSFH as the amount of mass transformed into
    stars, as a function of time and metallicity, in order to account for
    the population of stars contained in a particular volume.

    We present a new package to derive SFHs from CMD fitting tailored to
    work with Gaia data, called CMDft.Gaia, and we use it to analyse the
    CMD of the Gaia Catalogue of Nearby Stars (GCNS), which contains a
    complete census of the (mostly thin disc) stars currently within
    100pc of the Sun.

    We present an unprecedentedly detailed view of the evolution of the
    Milky Way disc at the solar radius. The bulk of star formation started
    11-10.5Gyr ago at metallicity around solar, and continued with a
    slightly decreasing metallicity trend until 6Gyr ago. Between 6 and
    4Gyr ago, a notable break in the age-metallicity distribution is
    observed, with three stellar populations with distinct metallicities
    (sub-solar, solar, and super-solar), possibly indicating some dramatic
    event in the life of our Galaxy. Star formation then resumed 4Gyr ago
    with a somewhat bursty behaviour, metallicity near solar and average
    star formation rate higher than in the period before 6Gyr ago. The
    derived metallicity distribution closely matches precise spectroscopic
    data, which also show stellar populations deviating from solar
    metallicity. Interestingly, our results reveal the presence of
    intermediate-age populations exhibiting both a metallicity typical of
    the thick disc, approximately [M/H]=~-0.5, and super-solar
    metallicity.

    The many tests performed indicate that, with high-precision
    photometric and distance data such as that provided by Gaia,
    CMDft.Gaia is able to achieve a precision of ~10% and an accuracy
    better than 6% in the dating of stellar populations, even at old ages.
    A comparison with independent spectroscopic metallicity information
    shows that metallicity distributions are also determined with high
    precision, without imposing any a priori metallicity information in
    the fitting process. This opens the door to obtaining detailed and
    robust information on the evolution of the stellar populations of the
    Milky Way over cosmic time. As an example, we provide in this paper an
    unprecedentedly detailed view of the age and metallicity distributions
    of the stars within 100 pc of the Sun.


Description:
    We deliver one file with the solution CMD obtained from the deSFH
    derived from the synthetic mother CMD named q01b03\_120M\_MG5. The
    file contains the (G_BP-G_RP) color, M_G magnitude, age and
    metallicity of each synthetic star in the solution. The number of
    stars in this solution CMD matches closely the number of stars in the
    observed CMD inside the bundle. See the paper entitled above for
    details.
